\section{Supersafety to Perfect Timeliness}

We now construct a perfectly timely protocol $\Pi^*$
using a black-box reduction from a supersafe, and live($u$) protocol $\Pi$.
Each honest party $P$, executing the $\Pi^*$ protocol, runs a
full node of protocol $\Pi$.
The ledger of party $P$ for protocol $\Pi$ and $\Pi^*$ is denoted as $\Ledger[][P][r]$ and
$\Ledger[*][P][r]$ respectively.
To construct temporal ledger $\Ledger[*][][r]$,
new transactions appearing in
$\Ledger[][][r]$ are appended to $\Ledger[*][][r - 1]$ with recorded round $r$.
This process is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:backward-reduction}
and the pseudocode is presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:backward-reduction}.

We now prove that protocol $\Pi^*$ is perfectly timely.

\begin{theorem}[Supersafety to Perfect Timeliness]
  An execution of protocol $\Pi^*$ is perfectly timely, supersafe, and live($u$), if the execution of
  protocol $\Pi$ is supersafe and live($u$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By the construction of $\Pi^*$, during round $r$, only transactions with
  recorded round $r$ can appear in honest ledger $\Ledger[*]$.
  Hence timeliness requirements (1) and (2) follow from the construction.
  We now prove requirement (3).
  Consider any honest party $P$ and any rounds $r_1 \leq r_2$.
  By the construction of $\Pi^*$, only transactions with recorded round greater
  than $r_1$ can appear in ledger $\Ledger[*][P][r_2]{[\Ledger[*][P][r_1]{:}]}$.
  Hence, $\Pi^*$ is timely with parameter $v = 0$, and therefore it is perfectly timely.

  At any round $r$, the transactions that appear in honest ledger $\Ledger$
  are the same with the transactions that appear in honest ledger $\Ledger[*]$.
  Hence, supersafety and liveness($u$) follow from the construction of $\Pi^*$.
  \Qed
\end{proof}
