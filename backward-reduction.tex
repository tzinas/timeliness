\subsection{Supersafety $\rightarrow$ Perfect Timeliness}\label{sec:backward-reduction}

We now construct a perfectly timely protocol $\Pi^*$
using a black-box reduction from a supersafe, and live($u$) protocol $\Pi$.
Each honest party $P$, executing the $\Pi^*$ protocol, runs a
full node of protocol $\Pi$.
The main idea is that, even though $\Pi$ is not a temporal ledger protocol,
since it is supersafe, we can simply
ascribe to each new transaction the round at which it first appeared on our ledger
without loss of safety.
% The ledger of party $P$ for protocol $\Pi$ and $\Pi^*$ is denoted as $\Ledger[][P][r]$ and
% $\Ledger[*][P][r]$ respectively.
% To construct temporal ledger $\Ledger[*][][r]$,
% new transactions appearing in
% $\Ledger[][][r]$ are appended to $\Ledger[*][][r - 1]$ with recorded round $r$.
This reduction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:backward-reduction}
and Algorithm~\ref{alg:backward-reduction}.

%We now prove that protocol $\Pi^*$ is perfectly timely.

\begin{theorem}[Supersafety to Perfect Timeliness] \label{thm:backward-reduction}
  An execution of $\Pi^*$ is perfectly timely, supersafe, and live($u$), if the execution of
  $\Pi$ is supersafe and live($u$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Timeliness requirements (1) and (2) are directly satisfied.
  For (3) consider any honest party $P$ and any rounds $r_1 \leq r_2$.
  Only transactions with recorded round greater
  than $r_1$ appear in ledger $\Ledger[*][P][r_2]{[|\Ledger[*][P][r_1]|{:}]}$.
  Hence, $\Pi^*$ is timely with parameter $v = 0$.
  Supersafety and liveness($u$) follow from those of $\Pi$.
  \Qed
\end{proof}

  \subsection{A Perfectly Timely, Supersafe Protocol with Clients}

  The protocol of the last subsection is perfectly time and supersafe.
  But how about late-joining clients?
  When a client first boots, it obtains all past transactions
  from $\Pi$.
  However, since $\Pi$ is not temporal, the client does not see any recorded rounds
  associated with the transactions. Additionally, since the recorded rounds depend
  on past ledger append times, the client cannot deduce them on its own.

  To enable client support, we make a small addition to the protocol:
  Each node runs an \emph{additional} instance of the internal
  ledger protocol $\Pi$
  to facilitate the booting of clients.
  We call $\Pi_1$ the first instance of $\Pi$
  (which operates as before),
  and $\Pi_2$ this new instance of $\Pi$.
  The output ledger $\Ledger[*]$ of the nodes remains the same.
  Since the online nodes have observed the rounds with which
  transactions of $\Pi_1$ are reported, they record those
  rounds on the second ledger $\Pi_2$ to help the client
  recover them.
  Let $\Ledger[1]$ and $\Ledger[2]$ be the output ledgers
  of $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$ respectively.
  The instance $\Pi_2$ is used as follows:
  In every round $r$,
  whenever new transactions appear in $\Ledger[*][][r]$,
  honest nodes introduce one transaction $\tx'$ in $\Pi_2$
  for each newly appearing transaction $\tx$ of $\Ledger[*][][r]$.
  The payload of $\tx'$ contains the pair $\left<\tx, r\right>$
  (and note that, here, $r$ is part of the transaction $\tx'$ payload,
  as $\Pi_2$ is not a temporal ledger protocol).
  We parameterize $\Pi_2$ with the following transaction validity language:
  Valid transactions $\tx'$ must take the form $\left<\tx, r\right>$,
  where $\tx$ first appeared in $\Ledger[*][][]$ at round $r$.
  Otherwise, the transaction is rejected as invalid.
  The protocol is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:client-support}.

  A late-joining client first synchronizes $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi_2$ with the rest
  of the peers.
  Due to safety, liveness and the validity rule of $\Pi_2$,
  the client can read ledger $\Ledger[2]$ to find out the
  recorded rounds of past transactions.
  Eventually, all past transaction recorded rounds are included in $\Ledger[2]$
  and the client can construct the correct temporal ledger $\Ledger[*]$.
  At this point we say the client is fully booted and can continue
  operating as a full online node without $\Pi_2$, i.e., it outputs the ledger $\Ledger[*]$.
  From this point on, the client is perfectly timely and supersafe.

      }

  Lastly, to make this protocol efficient, we observe that the payload of
  $\Pi_2$ transactions does not need to include the whole $\Pi_1$ transaction, but
  it is sufficient to include the transaction id only.
  Lastly, the two instances of $\Pi$ can be combined into one by coloring
  transactions appropriately: A normal transaction $\tx$, colored \emph{black}, enters into the
  $\Pi^*$ protocol and is recorded on $\Pi$ as usual. When it stabilizes and its round
  has been recorded by an online node, this node wraps the transaction $\tx$ into an
  \emph{orange} transaction $\tx'$ containing as payload $\tx$ together with its recorded
  round. The ledger output by $\Pi$ is split into black and orange parts. The black part
  is reported as the output ledger of $\Pi^*$. The orange part is used to help clients boot,
  and is ignored by a client after booting has finished. The validity language restrictions
  only apply to the orange transactions. This final construction is illustrated in
  Figure~\ref{fig:client-support-feedback}.
