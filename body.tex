% Stretch goals:
% - Prove results without a global clock (assuming clocks fall within a bounded difference)
% - Prove that variable difficulty bitcoin is timely
% - Make the timeliness proof abstract dependent only on 6 properties:
%   1) Common Prefix
%   2) Chain Quality
%   3) Chain Growth
%   4) Honest parties validate chain by: Increasing timestamps, No round in the future
%   5) Honest parties report current round
%   6) Confirmation rule is the same as Common Prefix
