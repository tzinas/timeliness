\section{Timeliness to Supersafety}\label{forward-reduction}

In this section we construct a supersafe protocol
$\Pi^*$ using a black-box reduction from a safe, live($u$) and timely($v$)
protocol $\Pi$.
Each honest party $P$, executing the $\Pi^*$ protocol, runs a
full node of protocol $\Pi$.
The ledger of party $P$ for protocol $\Pi$ and $\Pi^*$ is denoted as $\Ledger[][\Pi][r]$ and
$\Ledger[*][\Pi][r]$ respectively.
The main idea is that ledger $\Ledger[*][][r]$ is constructed
by filtering through ledger $\Ledger[][][r]$, and only keeping transactions
with recorded round less than or equal to $r - v$. When a transaction
is written to $P$, it is simply forwarded to the instance of protocol $\Pi$. This process is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:reduction-timeliness-supersafety}.

The pseudocode of protocol $\Pi^*$ is illustrated in Algorithm~\ref{alg:reduction-timeliness-supersafety}.
When the \rread function is invoked, the temporal ledger of party $P$ is acquired
in Line~\ref{line.reduction-t-s-ledger}.
Then, transactions with recorded round less than or equal to $\now - v$ are
filtered to create $\Ledger[*]$, which is returned in Line~\ref{line.reduction-t-s-filter}.
When the \wwrite function is invoked with transactions $\tx$, party $P^*$ simply writes $\tx$
to party $P$ in Line~\ref{line.reduction-t-s-write}.

Before proving protocol $\Pi^*$ is supersafe, we present
the following lemma\footnote{
  A variant of this auxiliary lemma was introduced and proven in earlier work~\cite{rollerblade}.
}, which allows us to argue that all
protocol $\Pi$ parties share a common view of sufficiently old transactions.

%TODO: Add figure for Past Perfect lemma
%TODO: Clean up network activity: as at least one new honest transaction $\tx'$
%      appears in the network at any round $r_3$, where $r_1 < r_3 \leq R - u$.
%TODO:


\begin{lemma}[Past Perfect]\label{lem:past-perfect}
  Consider a temporal ledger protocol $\Pi$'s
  execution with duration $R$ rounds in which $\Pi$ is
  safe, live($u$), and timely($v$).
  If for some honest party $P_1$ and some round $r_1$ it holds that
  $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[P_1][][r_1]$, then
  for all honest parties $P_2$ and for all rounds $r_2 \geq r^* + v$
  it holds that $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[P_2][][r_2]$,
  as long as at least one new honest transaction $\tx'$ appears in the
  network at any round $r_3$, where $r_1 < r_3 \leq R - u$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider an execution as in the statement and suppose, towards a contradiction,
  that $(r^*, \tx) = \Ledger[P_1][][r_1][k]$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
  but $(r^*, \tx) \not\in \Ledger[P_2][][r_2]$
  with $r_2 \geq r^* + v$.
  From safety,
  $\Ledger[P_2][][r_2] \prec \Ledger[P_1][][r_1]$ and
  $|\Ledger[P_2][][r_2]| \leq k < |\Ledger[P_1][][r_1]|$.
  Due to liveness, $(r', \tx') = \Ledger[P_2][][r_3 + u][k']$,
  for some $r', k' \in \mathbb{N}$.
  As $\tx'$ is new, it is not in $\Ledger[P_1][][r_1]$.
  Due to safety, $k' \geq |\Ledger[P_1][][r_1]| > k$, and
  $\Ledger[P_2][][r_3 + u][k] = (r^*, \tx)$.
  Therefore
  $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[P_2][][r_3 + u][|\Ledger[P_2][][r_2]|{:}]$.
  Since $r^* \leq r_2 - v$, this contradicts the timeliness with parameter $v$.\Qed
\end{proof}

\atnote{Add: The above lemma holds for already booted clients.}

\atnote{Adjust for $R - u$?}
\begin{theorem}[Timeliness to Supersafety]
  An execution of protocol $\Pi^*$, with duration $R$ rounds, is supersafe
  and live($u + v$), if the execution of the
  temporal ledger protocol $\Pi$ is safe, live($u$) and timely$(v)$
  as long as at least one new honest transaction appears in the
  network at all rounds before $R - u$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider any honest parties $P_1,P_2$, any round $r$, and any
  $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[][P_1][r]$, where $r^* \leq r - v$.
  From Lemma~\ref{lem:past-perfect} it holds that
  $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[][P_2][r]$.
  From this and from safety, it follows that
  $\Ledger[*][P_1][r] = [(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[][P_1][r]: r^* \leq r - v] \preceq
  [(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[][P_2][r]: r^* \leq r - v] = \Ledger[*][P_2][r]$.
  Inversely, $\Ledger[*][P_2][r] \preceq \Ledger[*][P_1][r]$.
  Therefore, $\Ledger[*][P_1][r] = \Ledger[*][P_2][r]$.
  Lastly, stickiness follows from the stickiness of $\Pi$.
  Therefore, $\Pi^*$ is supersafe.

  Liveness follows from the liveness of $\Pi$ with an added
  confirmation delay of $v$ rounds.
  % TODO: Maybe explain more:
  % Next, we prove liveness. Consider a transaction $\tx$
  % is written to any honest party at round $r$.
  % From the liveness of $\Pi$, for any honest party $P$, it holds that $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[][P][r + u]$.
  % Due to timeliness of $\Pi$, the recorded round of $\tx$ is $r^* \leq r + u$.
  % Hence, $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[*][P][r + u + v]$.
  \Qed
\end{proof}
