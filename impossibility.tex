\section{Impossibility}

\begin{lemma}[Timeliness is Impossible in Partial Synchrony]
  In a partially synchronous communication network, a distributed temporal ledger protocol
  which is safe and live$(u)$, cannot be timely.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose, towards a contradiction, a safe, live$(u)$, and timely$(v)$ distributed temporal ledger protocol.
  There is a fixed number of $n$ parties.
  Consider the following two worlds:

  \noindent
  \underline{World A}
  There are $n-1$ honest parties and one adversarial party. The adversary remains silent and
  does not disrupt the synchrony of the network.
  At round $r$, a transaction $\tx$ is introduced to the honest parties. We are in a
  synchronous network, hence, because of liveness, $\tx$ appears in the ledgers of all honest parties
  by round $r + u$. The transaction is recorded with round $r^* \leq r + u$ because of
  timeliness requirement \ref{def:timely-past}.

  \noindent
  \underline{World B}
  All parties are honest. We are under partial synchrony, and the adversary partitions the network such that
  one honest party is isolated from the other $n-1$ honest parties.
  Before \gst, at round $r$, a transaction $\tx$ is introduced to the $n-1$ connected
  honest parties. In the view of these parties,
  World 1 and World 2 are identical up to now. Hence, like in World 1,
  they report $\tx$ in their ledgers by round $r + u$, with recorded round $r^* \leq r + u$.

  The adversary sets \gst to  $r + u + v + 1$.
  After \gst, the transaction will eventually be included in $\Ledger[P]$ due to liveness,
  with recorded round $r^*$, due to safety.
  Hence, $(r^*, \tx) \in \Ledger[P][][r_2][|\Ledger[P][][r_1]]$,
  where $\gst \leq r_1 \leq r_2$.
  From the timeliness requirement \ref{def:timely-increasing}, we
  get $r^* > r_1 - v \geq \gst - v$, which calculates to $r^* > r + u$.
  This is a contradiction, since $r^* \leq r + u$.
\end{proof}
