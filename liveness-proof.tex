\section{Recency $\rightarrow$ Liveness}\label{appendix:recency-liveness}

Liveness and timeliness do not imply each other in general ledger protocols.
However, in ``reasonable'' chain-based ledger protocols, liveness and
timeliness are closely related, as they both arise from recency.

\begin{definition}[Unfiltered]
  A blockchain protocol is \emph{unfiltered} if every honest party $P$,
  when producing a block extending chain $C$, includes all transactions
  previously received by $P$ and are not already included in $C$.
  Furthermore, we assume implicit gossip: All new messages received by honest
  parties are gossiped.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
An execution of a ledger protocol based on an unfiltered and recent($w$)
blockchain protocol execution is live($w + 1$).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a ledger protocol execution as in the statement,
  and let transaction $\tx$ received by some honest party at round $r$.
  This transaction is received by all honest parties by round $r + 1$ due
  to implicit gossip. Consider an arbitrary honest party $P$. Due to recency,
  the chain $\Chain[][P][r + w + 1]$ contains an honest block $B$ produced at
  least at round $r + 1$. Because the execution is unfiltered, $\tx$
  is included in $\Chain[][P][r + w + 1]$, in or before block $B$.
  Hence, the ledger $\Ledger[][P][r + w + 1]$ contains $\tx$.
  \Qed
\end{proof}
