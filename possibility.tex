\section{Existing Blockchains are Timely}\label{sec:possible}

We posit that all popularly deployed flavors of blockchain protocols are timely.
The vast majority of real blockchain protocols are based on proof-of-work longest chain
% TODO(dionyziz): citations
(Bitcoin, Doge, Litecoin),
proof-of-stake longest chain
(Cardano),
proof-of-stake quorums
(Algorand, Cosmos),
or a mixture thereof
(Ethereum, Polkadot). As exemplary cases we prove that Bitcoin, Ouroboros, and Streamlet
are all timely, showing timeliness for each of the respective mechanisms.
