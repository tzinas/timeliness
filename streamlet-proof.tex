\subsection{Streamlet is Timely}

We now prove that the Partially Synchronous Streamlet Protocol is timely,
in the partially synchronous setting, after GST.
We work in the same model as the Streamlet paper~\cite{streamlet},
in particular assuming a PKI.

First, we turn Streamlet into a temporal blockchain protocol.
\emph{Temporal Streamlet} is the Streamlet protocol with the
following additions: No future epoch blocks are accepted. In each block, we report
$2\Delta e$ as the recorded round, where $e$ is its epoch.
Temporal Streamlet remains safe ---in their language \emph{consistent}--- and live($u$)
for $\frac{t}{n} < \frac{1}{3}$. Furthermore, it has consistent recorded rounds.

Honest party $P$, at the beginning of round $r$, and
before performing any other action, checks the network and
outputs the longest confirmed chain $\Chain[][P][r]$.
Let $G(e)$ be the predicate indicating that epochs $e-3,e-2,e-1,e,e+1$ have honest leaders.
Before proving freshness, we first show the maximum interval between two consecutive fully
honest epoch quintuples is bounded.

\begin{definition}[Temporal Streamlet Typical Execution]
  Consider an execution of the Temporal Streamlet protocol with duration
  of $E$ epochs, $n$ total number of parties and $t$ number of corrupt parties.
  Let $J = \{0,E\} \cup \{0 < e < E: G(e)\}$.
  The execution is \emph{typical} if for all
  $d \geq 5\frac{\kappa + \lg \floor*{\frac{E}{5}}}{- \lg \left(1 - \left(\frac{n - t}{n}\right)^5\right)}$:
  $\max_{e \in J}(\min_{\substack{e' > e \\ e' \in J}}(e' - e)) \leq d$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Temporal Streamlet Typicality] \label{lem:honest-quintuple}
  A Temporal Streamlet execution is typical, except with negligible probability in $\kappa$.
\end{lemma}

For the proof, see Appendix~\ref{sec:proofs}.

\begin{theorem}[Temporal Streamlet Freshness] \label{thm.streamlet-freshness}
  Typical executions of Temporal Streamlet are fresh with parameter $w = 2\Delta d$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $r$ be the current round of the current epoch $e$.
  Let $r^*$ and $e^*$ be the recorded round and, respectively, epoch of the tip
  of an honest party's confirmed chain.
  Let $e' = \max(\{\hat e \leq e: G(\hat e)\} \cup \{0\})$.
  From typicality, it holds that $e - e' \leq d$.
  From the proof of Streamlet liveness~\cite[Theorem 6]{streamlet}, epoch $e'$ contains a confirmed
  block. This block cannot be after the tip.
  Hence, $e' \leq e^*$. Therefore, $e - e^* \leq d \Rightarrow r - r^* \leq 2\Delta d$.
  \Qed
\end{proof}

From the above and Theorem~\ref{thm:freshness-to-timeliness}, it follows that
Temporal Streamlet is timely with parameter $v = 2\Delta d$.
